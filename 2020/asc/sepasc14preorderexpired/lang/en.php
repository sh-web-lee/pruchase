Unfortunately, most of them really didn't help or make a difference until I tried out Advanced System Care 14. I love that there are so many options and solutions to fix any problem. It's amazing how much faster my PC is now after the first scan and repair. Definitely the best product I have come across.",

        43=>'The features in Advanced System Care (ASC) 14 are awesome and the overall appearance is clean, fresh, and modern. I have used other all-in-one system maintenance programs, but none have been as effective as ASC 14. The program reduces and eliminates the use of non-essential resources which allow your computer to run cooler and more efficiently. This product is amazing and the best in class. If you care about your laptop or pc, use Advanced System Care 14!',
